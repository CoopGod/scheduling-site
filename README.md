ONLINE SCHEDULER

WHY:
This tool is used for ease of access to my collegues and I's shifts.
The original Excel spread sheet we were given by our manager needed some heavy improvements.
Many people, NOT excluding myself, missed shifts causing lots of panic.

RUNDOWN:
The tool takes on a CSV file, Uploads the Data to a SQL database and then displays the data from the database in a neat, simple website using jinja and flask.

LANGUAGES USED:
The tool is coded python, displayed using HTML & CSS along with Jinja, with a database in SQL.
